Welcome to the **Elastropy Blog** â€“ a private space, available only to **active members** of our community.

This is where we share our original writings and deep-dive explorations on topics like:

- **Data Science**
- **Computational Mechanics**
- **Machine Learning & Neural Networks**
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**
- ðŸ“š Plus the occasional **story-driven tutorials** and real-world **use case breakdowns**

We write not just to inform, but to teach, explore, and sometimes question â€” blending theory, experiments, and implementation in one place.

ðŸ’¾ **Download Source Codes of All the YouTube Video Tutorials**  
Active members can also download **all source codes from our YouTube tutorials** by clicking on the **"Source File Downloads"** link in the top navigation bar.

This blog is part of our broader learning ecosystem â€” designed to support hands-on learners, curious builders, and professionals working at the intersection of science and software.

Stay curious. Stay sharp.  
You're in good company here.

Thanks and regards  
Team Elastropy
